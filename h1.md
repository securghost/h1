### Any episode from Darknet Diaries Podcast.

**EP 133: I'M THE REAL CONNOR**
The podcast explores a case of identity theft and impersonation, where someone named Connor Tumbleson discovers that his resume was copied and used to apply for jobs.
Connor receives an unexpected interview invitation for a job he didn't apply for, realizing that his resume was copied. He decides to join the interview to investigate further. 
Connor finds out that a person named Andrew was contacted and asked to impersonate him in the interview. Andrew declines due to ethical concerns.
During the interview, another person claiming to be Connor Tumbleson joins, creating confusion. The real Connor confronts the impersonator, who leaves abruptly.
Connor seeks more information from Andrew, uncovering fake Upwork and Slack accounts. The mystery deepens as he tries to understand the motives behind the impersonation.
Connor discovers a website called PND Design linked to the impersonation. He attempts to contact the owner but receives no response.
The story connects to Brian Krebs' investigation into fake LinkedIn profiles used for job applications and how it impacts the recruitment process.
The podcast highlights the significance of Connor's GitHub history, which spans over a decade, making it difficult to fake a long-standing reputation.
Connor's blog post about the incident gains attention on platforms like Hacker News, leading to people sharing similar experiences of job-related impersonation.
The podcast shares related stories, including individuals working multiple remote jobs simultaneously without their employers' knowledge (overemployment).
Reference is made to a previous **episode 119** https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/119/ where someone from North Korea attempted to apply for a job to potentially steal cryptocurrency from the target company.
The podcast reflects on the emerging trend of overemployment and unethical practices related to remote work.
The podcasts focus on identity theft, impersonation, overemployment, and cryptocurrency-related job scams.
The incidents explored highlight the challenges and risks associated with the modern working environment, especially remote work and online job applications.
The victims, including Connor, struggle to get clear answers from the impersonators, emphasizing the difficulty of tracing and confronting malicious actors online.

**My thoughts about the matter**
Is there any recourse for individuals experiencing identity theft? While it's undoubtedly challenging for an average person to delve into the intricacies of the other party's actions to understand the how and why, the crucial question is: how can we prevent such information leaks for future reference? Additionally, where should one turn for assistance in matters like these? Is there a comprehensive solution in place as this episode still seems to be unsolved, leaving their readers in doubt how we would be able to protect ourselves in situations like this. 

### Hutchins et al 2011: Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chains, chapters Abstract, 3.2 Intrusion Kill Chain and 3.3 Courses of Action

The article discusses the concept of intrusion kill chains as a model for understanding and responding to advanced persistent threats (APTs) in computer network defense. The text outlines the phases of an intrusion kill chain, including reconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, exploitation, installation, command and control (C2), and actions on objectives. It emphasizes the importance of aligning defensive capabilities with specific adversary processes and utilizing actionable intelligence for resiliency.
The text includes a matrix of courses of action, highlighting various defensive measures such as detection, denial, disruption, degradation, deception, and destruction at different phases of the intrusion kill chain. The goal is to achieve completeness and resiliency in defense against persistent adversaries.
A case study from Lockheed Martin's Computer Incident Response Team (LM-CIRT) in March 2009 is presented to illustrate the benefits of applying intrusion kill chain analysis. The case study involves three intrusion attempts by an adversary using targeted malicious emails with a common APT tactic. The defenders successfully detected and mitigated these intrusions, even when a zero-day vulnerability was exploited. The study emphasizes the importance of intelligence-driven defense in countering APTs.
The document concludes by highlighting the asymmetry between aggressors and defenders in the kill chain, emphasizing the value of understanding adversary behaviors, intent, and patterns of operation. The intrusion kill chain is presented as a framework to prioritize defensive measures, measure their effectiveness, and turn the persistence of adversaries into a liability. The text also suggests future research areas, such as exploring the cost-benefit ratio for intruders and developing models of information superiority.

## b) Bookworm. Install Debian 12-Bullseye virtual machine in VirtualBox. (See also: Karvinen 2021: Install Debian on VirtualBox)

### Report:

**Step 1:** Put your procastination skills to the side and start the work. 
**Step 2:** Starting time: 2:55am. Opened the link https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current-live/amd64/iso-hybrid/ and started downloading an image (at 3am). ![image](https://github.com/securghost/h1/assets/142783540/4bf2dc14-e417-4073-919d-1b672adda39b) Estimated downloading time showed to be 9 minutes.

**Step 3:** Meanwhile, as I did not have Virtualbox yet downloading, started to do that. Also sidenote for the teacher - it would be nice if the links on the website would open in a different window/ tab. However, I did manage to get the same effect while holding CTRL button down. Just had to go back to open that link in a new tab. 

Debian pic was downloaded 3.05am. 

**Step 4:** While trying to download Virtualbox, got the message:
Oracle VM VirtualBox 7.0.14 needs the Microsoft Visual C++ 2019 Redistributable Package being installed first. Please install and restart the installation of Oracle VM VirtualBox 7.0.14.

**Step 5:** Downloading Microsoft Visual C++ 2022 REdistributable Package as it was the latest. 
![image](https://github.com/securghost/h1/assets/142783540/471d8fad-5433-4843-b4d9-fc4a194e0b1b)

![image](https://github.com/securghost/h1/assets/142783540/1c4bd7ae-09c9-4cac-b1e6-6f92ef8a0dad)

And then, my "favourite" part on downloading anything: reading the small print part. So I made myself a cup a coffee and started reading MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS MICROSOFT VISUAL STUDIO COMMUNITY 2022 and Microsoft Privacy Statement at 3:25am.

At 3:48am, when reaching to the end of license terms, the last paragraph seemed somewhat "interesting":
![image](https://github.com/securghost/h1/assets/142783540/6cd865b1-ca3f-4892-b288-0d5b8ccfee55)

As usual, there are tons of different links added to these documents. So I also found the article "Privacy for young people". Which, basically was quite the same as longer version, only more in understandable language for people who do not understand legally technical language. Why was it called as "Privacy for young people" beats me, as it could be for anyone who's not into technical reading to comprehend it better. 

![image](https://github.com/securghost/h1/assets/142783540/57b8fcdb-a9b4-469e-b2a5-7f02f4dfb500)

At 4:13am I started reading the article: Microsoftâ€™s GDPR Commitments to Customers of our Generally Available Enterprise Software Products. 

I also followed the ad setting page to see the situation and was fairly surprised to see that personalized ads were on as I am quite sure, that I've always turned them off from the start. But it's good that I checked, as I was able to turn them off again. Hopefully, it will stay like that.

**Step 6:** at 4:21am, after all this reading, I was finally able to press continue

![image](https://github.com/securghost/h1/assets/142783540/454755d1-726e-4131-84e0-9969738e2ae4)

Then, I found myself in a situation, where I would have liked to be able to ask, which boxes should I choose. As there were quite many of them and I have no idea, which one's I actually need. 
Also, at this point, I'm just hoping that I'm on the right track and not doing any unnecessary steps..
![image](https://github.com/securghost/h1/assets/142783540/98355b8b-f5f9-48cb-9472-cd4eeb2b8ec8)

So I chose the one's that kind of made sense, while not being actually sure if they made sense:
![image](https://github.com/securghost/h1/assets/142783540/f483a7ab-92f6-4edb-b176-3d3ff81c51ec)

and then, before hitting the button "Install" 

![image](https://github.com/securghost/h1/assets/142783540/8120b524-fc5d-4aeb-81e0-67f49cf89bcb)

I did decide to check also individual components tab to see if I actually have everything I need (in my opinion, as I'm still note quite sure, what would I actually need). 

![image](https://github.com/securghost/h1/assets/142783540/d69afeae-2773-4cd5-9a4d-fdac805d8757)

At 4:38am I finally hit the install button. 

At 4:56am it was finally done:

![image](https://github.com/securghost/h1/assets/142783540/9d2cad80-950b-4abe-b3a5-0296d13d6dbd)

So I was finally able to install the VirtualBox:

![image](https://github.com/securghost/h1/assets/142783540/a553c861-cc1a-42bc-9604-8d1a8e51660d)

![image](https://github.com/securghost/h1/assets/142783540/d88a8e72-cc06-48b8-a55a-be6076cf42c4)

Got the warning:
![image](https://github.com/securghost/h1/assets/142783540/bf7ce6ea-8275-4e9e-bd23-fc982b4e1d2a)
So decided to save any changes and continue with the installation. 


## o) Voluntary bonus: My fundaments. What do you consider the fundamentals of security? What would you teach the first day?

As a newbie in the information/cybersecurity area, I do feel like there is a lot to comprehend. Everything feels like potential treath and lacking knowledge of how or what to pay attention to does not help much. 
From that perspective, I'd like to discuss on the 1st day what to pay attention to, so one could feel a bit more safe, while having to do homework. For example, safe downloading for needed software. How to make sure, that the link that is being used to get to the download page, is legit. What to pay attention to, while trying to figure out safe pages and links to follow. And maybe some kind of ensurance how not to screw yourself over while doing necessary procedures. 

My biggest fear, when entering into this mayor without any prior knowledgement nor practice, was that as we have to use our own laptops, I might download something not safe and therefore make myself vulnerable for threats.
